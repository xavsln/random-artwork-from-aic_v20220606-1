# App description:

This is a simple JavaScript App that shows Artworks on a single page.

These Artworks are fetched from the Art Institute of Chicago API (AIC API).

The main page shows 10 Artworks then the User can append 10 more Artworks each time he / she clicks on the "See more Artwork" button.

In case User wants to clear the page he can do so by clicking on the "Clear page" button located at the bottom of the page.
